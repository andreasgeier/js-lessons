Steve falls off and is killed instantly.\n\nAs the ambulance takes the body away, Bruce says, \'Someone should go and tell his wife.\'\n\nJed says, \'OK, I\'m pretty good at that sensitive stuff, I\'ll do it.\'\n\nTwo hours later, he comes back carrying a case of beer.\n\nBruce says, \'Where did you get that, Jed?\'\n\n\'Steve\'s wife gave it to me,\' Jed replies.\n\n\'That\'s unbelievable, you told the lady her husband was dead and she gave you beer?\'\n\nWell, not exactly\', Jed says. \'When she answered the door, I said to her, \"You must be Steve\'s widow\".\'\n\nShe said, \'No, I\'m not a widow!\'\n\nAnd I said, \'I\'ll bet you a case of Budweiser you are."
